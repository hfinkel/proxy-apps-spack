class Vpfft(CMakePackage):
    """ Proxy Application. VPFFT is an implementation of a mesoscale micromechanical materials 
    model. By solving the viscoplasticity model, VPFFT simulates the evolution
     of a material under deformation. The solution time to the viscoplasticity 
     model, described by a set of partial differential equations, is 
     significantly reduced by the application of Fast Fourier Transform 
     in the VPFFT algorithm.
