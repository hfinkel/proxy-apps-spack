    """Proxy Application. VPFFT is an implementation of a mesoscale
    micromechanical materials model. By solving the viscoplasticity
    model, VPFFT simulates the evolution of a material under deformation.
    The solution time to the viscoplasticity model, described by a set
    of partial differential equations, is significantly reduced by the
    application of Fast Fourier Transform in the VPFFT algorithm.
