    """Kripke is a simple, scalable, 3D Sn deterministic particle transport
    code. Its primary purpose is to research how data layout, programming 
    paradigms and architectures effect the implementation and performance 
    of Sn transport. A main goal of Kripke is investigating how different 
    data-layouts effect instruction, thread and task level parallelism, 
    and what the implications are on overall solver performance."""
